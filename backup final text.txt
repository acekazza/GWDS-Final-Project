In this worksheet, the focus is on creating an HTML document and learning how to code common tags that create a webpage. It begins with creating a new GitHub repository followed by an index.html file in Visual Studio Code. Followed by structuring the code tags, “<body></body>”, “<h></h>” etc. in the right following order so that the data within sits neatly and is presented how we want it to be. Furthermore, an important repetitive process to remember was to save, commit and push our code into the GitHub repository.





Whilst completing the task I managed to easily read through and implement all coding tasks provided. However, the only challenge I came across at that start was forgetting a few times to repeat the save, commit, and push code process. But shortly after it became natural to me, I was able to follow the task and stay consistent with the GitHub save process. Throughout the other coding tasks, I am happy to say I remember each time do save my updates to the GitHub repository.

During this task, I was proud to say that I had also easily understood the coding tasks. Despite that, one problem that occurred during the implementation was my image source code tag was not working at the start. After tracing through my steps I identified that the problem was my misspelling, this led to my image not displaying on the webpage. After spelling the path name of my image correctly. The image was visible and structured accurately according to the task.


During this task, I was proud to have easily understood the coding tasks. However, one issue occurred during the implementation: my image source code tag didn't work initially. Upon reviewing my steps, I discovered that the problem came from a misspelling, causing the image not to display on the webpage. Once I corrected the path name spelling for the image, it became visible and was accurately structured according to the task's requirements.

Throughout this task, I was able to move through all the steps swiftly up until step 7 which I found quite challenging, it was designating the column to appear vertically rather than horizontally. After looking back at the steps within the worksheet I figured that by changing my flex-direction in the CSS stylesheet from a ‘row’ to a ‘column’ I was able to resolve the problem successfully. 


Throughout this task, I smoothly progressed through all the steps until I reached step 7, which presented a fair challenge. Although, upon reviewing the worksheet's steps, I realised that modifying the 'flex-direction' property in the CSS stylesheet from 'row' to 'column' enabled me to resolve the issue effectively. This was a rewarding experience for me, significantly boosting my confidence in problem-solving when it comes to HTML and CSS.

During this task, I was quick to learn and go through the steps efficiently. In addition, I found the creation of button links to new HTML webpages very helpful as I was able to implement this process within my Website design to make it easier for the viewer to navigate around the site. One challenge I came across was I stumbled upon a dead image link which led to my image not displaying. However, after quick research, I was able to find a more reliable site that provided working image links which I had used in my example.

Throughout this task, I quickly understood the steps and was able to implement them within my Web page. The creation of button links for new HTML web pages was significantly useful which improved the site's navigation. However, I faced a challenge when a dead image link caused my image to not display. Fortunately, a quick research session led me to a more reliable source for functional image links, which I then integrated into my example.

An axial typographic system is a way of organising the text elements within a layout by consistent alignment such as aligning text on an axis. For example, I have created my aligned text on an angled axis which follows the direction of angled shape. Furthermore, the text outside is symmetrical pointing in the same direction of the shape 

An axial typographic system organises text elements in a layout through consistent alignment, often aligning text along an axis. For example, I've arranged my text along an angled axis, following the direction of a specific shape. Additionally, the text positioned outside maintains symmetry by pointing in the same direction as the shape.

A radial typographic system organises text elements to radiate outward from a central focal point, allowing the text to flow in a circular or radial direction. For instance, I created an eclipse shape in the center of the design. By aligning and shaping the text to follow the curves of the shape, the text flows outward in a consistent and visually appealing way, which guides the viewer’s attention from the center to the border of the layout. 


A dilatational typographic system arranges text along circular paths instead of radiating solely from a central point. It employs different text sizes to highlight essential information but also establish a visual hierarchy within the design. For instance, in my demonstration, I've showcased a hierarchy of smaller visual circles that gradually enlarge by size, creating a prominent focal point.

A transitional typographic system focuses on altering text styles within a design, implementing various fonts, sizes, or styles to ensure a smooth transition between different sections of the layout. In my demonstration, I have created a consistent angled flow for the text. Additionally, I’ve varied the fonts in terms of thickness and size, placing emphasis on the thicker text enhance the visual appeal. 

A random typographic system introduces unpredictability by arranging text elements without a specific pattern. It involves using different fonts, sizes or styles in a way that doesn’t follow an organised sequence. In my demonstration, my main text features a random pattern, and the spacing between certain text elements is deliberately unpredictable. Additionally, the smaller text flows in an unconventional pattern without coordination, creating irregular yet visually interesting elements.

A grid typographic system relies on a structured layout foundation to organise and align text elements effectively. This approach involves constructing a grid and boxes to neatly arrange text in columns and rows. In my demonstration, I have constructed organised columns with boxes, maintaining consistent vertical alignment. The text placement within these boxes is centered, resulting in an easy-to-read and clean presentation.

A modular typographic system organises text elements using a consistent grid structure. In my demonstration, I arranged my text within circular modules and repeated this structure, using white space effectively to separate the content. This approach creates a visually appealing layout while ensuring easy alignment of the text elements. 

A bilateral typographic system arranges text elements in a design to achieve balance on two sides. In my demonstration, I focused on maintaining the text symmetry between the top and bottom sides. I divided the content into groups and incorporated a non-objective circle shape that maintains symmetry. This organisation creates a visually pleasing structure.

In creating my main poster design, I applied the CARP principles – Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity- to guide my creative process. To demonstrate great contrast, I selected a black, white, and yellow color scheme. This complimented well against a black-and-white background image, allowing me to achieve a vintage aesthetic theme. The use of yellow served to highlight important information, ensuring its ease of notice. By highlighting the prices and keywords, amplified readability and clarity for the viewer.
To ensure the consistent alignment of elements, I utilised adobe illustrator’s grid layout feature, which allowed me to create guidelines around my poster to provide a structured frame, significantly assisting the organisation of elements on the page. In addition, implementing the flush left and right technique helped achieve a clean and precise alignment of all elements, which made the information clear and easy to follow, guiding the viewer’s focus seamlessly across the content. 
Repetition played a significant role throughout my design, particularly through the consistent use of shapes that were used as boxes for presenting information. This consistent repetition established a unified and structured layout when displaying similar content, contributing to visual appeal and overall consistency. By employing this repetition, my aim was not only to enhance content interest but also to aid viewers in navigating the poster seamlessly, resulting in a cohesive and attractive design.
To ensure optimal proximity, I strategically grouped my related text elements within the poster design. For instance, the dates of the month were deliberately aligned vertically and consistently presented using box elements. The deliberate arrangement aids viewers in swiftly identifying connections between pieces of information, significantly enhancing the poster’s clarity and ease of understanding.

were repeated to create a consistent structure when displaying similar information added visual interest to the content but also made it easier for viewers to navigate through the poster.

I started the framework of my HTML and CSS website by using a prompt from ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), this gave me a simple flexbox website with a sticky header that included the website header and the following page links. This gave me a relatively simple but good foundation to work with, and taught me basics of creating a simple sticky navigation bar that is easy to navigate. 
Furthermore, during the coding worksheet process, I was able to take and implement a lot of coding tags that I had learned and found very useful, one of them being the flex-box containers that I implemented into my graphic design webpage. This allowed me to gain a better understanding of how they are structured effectively and can be a good structure when having to display images followed by text. One challenge that I faced during this process was that the box elements within my container were displayed together with no effective white space between the boxes. After reviewing the coding worksheet slides I was able to find the solution to my problem and that was modifying the “justify-content” CSS property from “center” to “space-evenly” enabled me to resolve the issue effectively. I am happy to say that the coding worksheets were very helpful and that my understanding of HTML and CSS has grown a lot since the start of this module, I am now a lot more confident in problem-solving. 
In the typographic system project, I began with picking a color theme that would best suit my website design so I went for black and yellow as it would have contrasted well with my Poster project as this is a similar colour theme that I went for. Being a new user of Adobe Illustrator I had thought of struggling at first but shortly after going through the tutorial guides listed on Blackboard, I was able to grasp it fairly quickly. This helped me better my understanding on how to use adobe illustrator which I must say I am confident to use the tools such as constructing various shapes, lines and texts.
However, one challenge that I came across was making patterns with the text which was required to do on my random typographic system. After messing about with the options at the top of the bar I was able to find an effect feature which included various of different effects to implement within my text. This aided me to be able to apply the warp text and create the desired pattern that I wanted to achieve. Therefore, the most rewarding aspect of this was that although I was hopeless at start I ended up gaining a lot of understanding and skills that I thought would take long to acquire.
Lastly, my poster project was the one I was looking forward to the most as I have had previous experience with Adobe Indesign and Adobe Photoshop. Considering the CARP principles carefully I read Robin, W (2008) online design book which covered a lot of useful information on the principles necessary to make a great standard poster. This allowed me to apply a lot of the knowledge to my poster for example creating great alignment and proximity by applying the flush left and right technique which created a clean yet precise alignment of the elements within my poster, making the information clear and easy to follow. However, one challenge I faced from the start was I had a male skater background image which did not suit the content of poster requirements as it required a girl skate clinic targeted at women. After coming quickly to this conclusion, I had difficulty finding an effective image of a female skater as there are limited images online but more importantly, finding an image that would be suitable for my alignment principles. Therefore, the most rewarding aspect of this experience was that by putting in the time and effort to research I can find good and reliable resources for project content.
In conclusion, I have gained various skills during the process of this GWDS project such as problem solving and discipline. But more importantly the skills gained from process of creating these projects such as the Adobe software, GitHub, and many more. Which will benefit me in future assignments or independent tasks, as I am a lot more confident and interested in using the skills learned.


This allowed me to be more confident about my problem-solving skills as I am able to identify and resolve HTML and CSS problems.

 I am happy to say that following this coding worksheets my understanding of HTML and CSS has grew a lot and I am now able to problem solve most of the problems I am faced with.
