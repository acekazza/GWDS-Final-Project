                <div class="mediacontent">I started the framework of my HTML and CSS website by using a prompt from ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), this gave me a straightforward flexbox website featuring a sticky header containing the website header and subsequent page links. This initial setup offered a relatively simple yet robust foundation, teaching me the basics of creating a sticky navigation bar that ensures easy navigation.  </div>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="image">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">Throughout the coding worksheet process, I effectively applied numerous coding tags that I had learned, in particular utilising the flex-box containers within my graphic design webpage. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of their structured effectiveness, especially in organising images followed by text. However, I encountered a challenge as the box elements within the container appeared together without appropriate white space. Reviewing the coding worksheet slides helped me find a solution—I modified the 'justify-content' CSS property from 'center' to 'space-evenly,' effectively resolving the issue. These coding worksheets significantly aided my learning journey, improving my skills in HTML and CSS. As a result, my confidence in problem-solving has substantially grown throughout this module. </div>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="image">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">In the typographic system project, I began by selecting the color theme black and yellow as that would have coordinated well with my website design. This choice aimed to create a contrastive link with my previous Poster project, which shared a similar colour palette. Although I was new to Adobe Illustrator, I initially anticipated challenges. However, by following the tutorial guides available on Blackboard, I quickly gained insight. This learning experience significantly enhanced my understanding of Adobe Illustrator, allowing me to confidently use its tools for creating shapes, lines, and texts. </div>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="image">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">However, one challenge that I encountered was creating patterns with the text, which was for my random typographic system. Initially, I struggled to navigate the options available in the toolbar. Yet I discovered an ‘effect’ feature that offered a variety of text feature tools. Utilising the ‘warp text’ feature from these options allowed me to create the desired pattern I wanted. The most fulfilling aspect of this challenge was the growth in my understanding and skill set. Despite my initial struggles, I gained valuable knowledge and skills more quickly than I had anticipated. </div>

                <div class="image">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">My poster project was the one I was most excited about due to my experience with Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop. Prior to creating the poster, I delved into Robin, W’s (2008) online design book, which offered useful insights into the CARP principles important for a good quality poster. I applied this knowledge, particularly focusing on achieving great alignment and proximity structure. Implementing the flush left and right technique, I attained a clean, precise arrangement of elements within my poster, strengthening information clarity and readability. </div>

            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="image">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">However, from the start, I faced a challenge with my choice of a male skater background image, which was not suitable for a poster targeting a girl skate clinic aimed at women. Realising this early on, I encountered a difficulty finding an appropriate image of a female skater that not only fit the content but also adhered to my alignment principles. It was a struggle, considering the limited availability of suitable images online. </div>
            </div>



            <div class="media-container">
                <div class="image">
                    
                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">Nevertheless, the most rewarding takeaway from this experience was realising the power of dedicated research efforts. Putting in the time and effort allowed me to discover reliable and fitting resources for my project content, a valuable lesson that significantly contributed to my project's success. </div>

                </div>
                <div class="mediacontent">In conclusion, the GWDS project has been important in developing my skills, particularly in problem-solving and discipline. Furthermore, the experience has equipped me with a better understanding of various tools like Adobe software, GitHub, and more. These skills are key assets that will significantly benefit me in future assignments or independent tasks. I’ve gained not just confidence but also a genuine interest in utilising these newly acquired skills effectively. </div>
