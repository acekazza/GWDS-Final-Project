                <p class="type-text"> While completing the task, I managed to easily read through and implement all coding tasks provided. However, the initial challenge I encountered was occasionally forgetting to repeat the save, commit, and push code process at the start. Nevertheless, shortly after, it became second nature to me, enabling me to follow the task and maintain consistency with the GitHub save process. Throughout the other coding tasks, I'm pleased to say that I consistently remembered to save my updates to the GitHub repository each time.</p>

              <div class="text-box">
                <p class="type-text"> During this task, I was proud to have easily understood the coding tasks. However, one issue occurred during the implementation: my image source code tag didn't work initially. Upon reviewing my steps, I discovered that the problem came from a misspelling, causing the image not to display on the webpage. Once I corrected the path name spelling for the image, it became visible and was accurately structured according to the task's requirements.</p>

                <p class="type-text">Throughout this task, I smoothly progressed through all the steps until I reached step 7, which presented a fair challenge. Although, upon reviewing the worksheet's steps, I realised that modifying the 'flex-direction' property in the CSS stylesheet from 'row' to 'column' enabled me to resolve the issue effectively. This was a rewarding experience for me, significantly boosting my confidence in problem-solving when it comes to HTML and CSS.</p>

              <div class="text-box">
                <p class="type-text"> Throughout this task, I quickly understood the steps and was able to implement them within my Web page. The creation of button links for new HTML web pages was significantly useful which improved the site's navigation. However, I faced a challenge when a dead image link caused my image to not display. Fortunately, a quick research session led me to a more reliable source for functional image links, which I then integrated into my example.</p>
