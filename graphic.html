                    <p class="typo-text caption">An axial typographic system organises text elements in a layout through consistent alignment, often aligning text along an axis. For example, I've arranged my text along an angled axis, following the direction of the specific shape. Additionally, the text positioned outside maintains symmetry by pointing in the same direction as the shape.</p>

                    <p class="typo-text caption">A radial typographic system organises text elements to radiate outward from a central focal point, allowing the text to flow in a circular or radial direction. For instance, I created an eclipse shape in the center of the design. By aligning and shaping the text to follow the curves of the shape, the text flows outward in a consistent and visually appealing way, which guides the viewer’s attention from the center to the border of the layout.

                    <p class="typo-text caption">A dilatational typographic system arranges text along circular paths instead of radiating solely from a central point. It employs different text sizes to highlight essential information but also establish a visual hierarchy within the design. In my demonstration, I've showcased a hierarchy of smaller visual circles that gradually enlarge by size, creating a prominent focal point. </p>

                    <p class="typo-text caption">A random typographic system introduces unpredictability by arranging text elements without a specific pattern. It involves using different fonts, sizes, or styles in a way that doesn’t follow an organised sequence. In my demonstration, the main text features a random pattern, and the spacing between certain text elements is deliberately unpredictable. Additionally, the smaller text flows in an unconventional pattern without coordination, creating irregular yet visually interesting elements.</p>

                    <p class="typo-text caption">A grid typographic system relies on a structured layout foundation to organise and align text elements effectively. This approach involves constructing a grid and boxes to neatly arrange text in columns and rows. In my demonstration, I have constructed organised columns with boxes, maintaining consistent vertical alignment. The text placement within these boxes is centered, resulting in an easy-to-read and clean presentation.</p>

                        A modular typographic system organises text elements using a consistent grid structure. In my demonstration, I arranged my text within circular modules and repeated this structure, using white space effectively to separate the content. This approach creates a visually appealing layout while ensuring easy alignment of the text elements.

                    <p class="typo-text caption">A transitional typographic system focuses on altering text styles within a design, implementing various fonts, sizes, or styles to ensure a smooth transition between different sections of the layout. In my demonstration, I have created a consistent angled flow for the text. Additionally, I’ve varied the fonts in terms of thickness and size, placing emphasis on the thicker text enhance the visual appeal.  </p>

                    <p class="typo-text caption">A bilateral typographic system arranges text elements in a design to achieve balance on two sides. In my demonstration, I focused on maintaining the text symmetry between the top and bottom sides. I divided the content into groups and incorporated a non-objective circle shape that maintains symmetry. This organisation creates a visually pleasing structure.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="typo-text dark center">In creating my main poster design, I applied the CARP principles – Contrast, Alignment, Repetition, and Proximity- to guide my creative process. To demonstrate great contrast, I selected a black, white, and yellow color scheme. This complimented well against a black-and-white background image, allowing me to achieve a vintage aesthetic theme. The use of yellow served to highlight important information, ensuring its ease of notice. By highlighting the prices and keywords, amplified readability and clarity for the viewer.
                
                


                </p>
                <p class="typo-text dark center">
                    To ensure the consistent alignment of elements, I utilised adobe illustrator’s grid layout feature, which allowed me to create guidelines around my poster to provide a structured frame, significantly assisting the organisation of elements on the page. In addition, implementing the flush left and right technique helped achieve a clean and precise alignment of all elements, which made the information clear and easy to follow, guiding the viewer’s focus seamlessly across the content. 
                    
                    </p>
            
                    <p class="typo-text dark center"> Repetition played a significant role throughout my design, particularly through the consistent use of shapes that were used as boxes for presenting information. This consistent repetition established a unified and structured layout when displaying similar content, contributing to visual appeal and overall consistency. By employing this repetition, my aim was not only to enhance content interest but also to aid viewers in navigating the poster seamlessly, resulting in a cohesive and attractive design.

                        <p class="typo-text dark center"> To ensure optimal proximity, I strategically grouped my related text elements within the poster design. For instance, the dates of the month were deliberately aligned vertically and consistently presented using box elements. The deliberate arrangement aids viewers in swiftly identifying connections between pieces of information, significantly enhancing the poster’s clarity and ease of understanding.
